=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::AJAXUpload - Run mode to handle a file upload and return a JSON response

=head1 VERSION

This document describes CGI::Application::Plugin::AJAXUpload version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use CGI::Application::Plugin::AJAXUpload;

=for author to fill in:
    Brief code example(s) here showing commonest usage(s).
    This section will be as far as many users bother reading
    so make it as educational and exeplary as possible.
  
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a customizable run mode that handles a file upload
and responds with a JSON message like the following:

    {status: 'UPLOADED', image_url: '/img/uploads/666.png'}

or on failure

    {status: 'The image was too big.'}

This is specifically intended to provide a L<CGI::Application> based back
end for L<AllMyBrain.com|http://allmybrain.com>'s 
L<image upload extension|http://allmybrain.com/2007/10/16/an-image-upload-extension-for-yui-rich-text-editor> to the
L<YUI rich text editor|http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor>. However as far as
I can see it could be used as a back end for any L<CGI::Application> website that uploads files behind the scenes using AJAX. In any case this module does NOT
provide any of that client side code and you must also map the run mode onto the URL used by client-side code.
